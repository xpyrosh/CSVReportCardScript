# How to use:

I have provided two options two run this application based on preference. 

Be sure to have Java jdk-12.0.2 installed on the machine you are attempting to run the application on as it will not compile on older versions.

## First method:

The first method would be to open the project in Eclipse; so long as you include the courses.csv, marks.csv, students.csv and tests.csv in the CSVReportCardScript folder. Once open in Eclipse; first go to Project and select Clean.. then you may run the project. Upon running, a reportcard.txt file will be generated in the CSVReportCardScript folder along side the CSV files.

## Second method:

I have also provided a test folder with my submission which includes an executable JAR file. You may replace the courses.csv, marks.csv, students.csv and tests.csv from the test folder with the new CSV's you'd like to test and simply double click the JAR to run it. Granted that you have the correct JDK installed a reportcard.txt should appear.


# About:

The objective of this application is to generate a student report card file. This application will take four files which include student, course, test and mark data and then do the necessary calculations for determining the student's grades. On completion of the application a user will receive a text file with a detailed output of students, their grades and respective courses taken.
